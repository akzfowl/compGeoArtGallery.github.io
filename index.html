			<H2>Motivation:</H2>
			<p>
			The art gallery problem is a well known one which has applications in wide and interesting areas. Although it is framed as a security problem where guards vigilantly protect an art gallery, it can also be framed as an illumination problem. This transforms it into providing optimal illumination within a closed building while minimizing the number of lights being used. This issue of visibility can be used within games for level design as well - just imagine a group of non-player characters patrolling an area while the player himself has to stealthily move around or even attack them. Interestingly enough, the art gallery problem is almost directly applicable to tower defence style games where the player needs to place objects like turrets at various positions within a structure to secure it against adversaries that gradually increase in strength and speed. 
			<br><br>
			Along with the above use cases, the art gallery problem also seems applicable to areas such as the design of buildings and vehicles, route planning and even circuit design. For these reasons, and because it presents such an interesting setting along with many intriguing variations, we have decided to look at this problem and hope to gain some insight into how computer scientists over the ages have chosen to tackle it, and perhaps contribute something as well.

			<H2>Description:</H2>
			<p>The art gallery problem is also popularly called the museum problem. In computational geometry literature, it is also referred to as the Vertex-Pi Floodlights problem. The problem is named after the real-world problem of guarding an art gallery or a museum with as few guards as possible in such a way that the guards are collectively able to keep all parts of the museum in sight at all times. In computational geometry, the gallery is typically represented using a 'simple polygon' (a flat shape created by straight, non-intersecting sides that form a closed path in a pair-wise fashion). A set of points is said to 'guard' a portion of the polygon if, for each point 'a' inside the polygon, another point 'b' exists such that the line joining 'a' and 'b' does not have any portion outside the polygon.
			<br><br>
			As part of our project, we plan to survey the body of work surrounding this well-studied problem, arrive at the best methods available, try out our own methods of solving the problem and also look at known variations of the problem involving moving guards and polygons of varying shapes.
			<br><br>
			Ideally, we would also like to have a few implementations of the problem that can be used to run simulations of it along with showcasing possible solutions in a web application.</p>
